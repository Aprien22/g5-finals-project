# LINEAR ALGEBRA: Automated Matrix Diagonalizer PROJECT
<b>Linear Algebra</b> is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with vectors, matrices, and linear transformations. 
It provides the theoretical foundation for understanding matrix operations and their applications in science, engineering, and computer science.

<b>Matrix diagonalization</b> is a process that transforms a matrix into a diagonal form, simplifying complex matrix operations. This technique is essential for solving differential equations, computing matrix powers, and understanding the behavior of linear systems.

## TASK: Automated Matrix Diagonalizer
Build a program/application that accepts an n-by-n matrix A, where n ≤ 5, and checks if the given matrix is diagonalizable or not. If the matrix A is diagonalizable, the program generates a nonsingular matrix P and a diagonal matrix D such that P^−1AP = D.
